This represents the current thinking about what technologies should be used for various purposes. It's a guide for making technical decisions without having to have the entire team sync up on everything. It also allows you to experiment with new technologies safely by seeing what others have discovered, or not.

## üìñ How to Use This Radar

### üíç Rings

The Rings are indicators of how fit a technology or technique is for use, and these should be your guide when making technical decisions.

1.  **Adopt**
  
  Technologies here are what we are using consistency across most, if not all, projects & teams. In general, you should use these unless you have a **very** good reason not to. **Not** using technologies here would be a technical risk.

2.  **Trial**

    Technologies in production now, but not consistently across the team. These are worth pursuing, but we haven't yet rolled them out team-wide. They are great choices for projects where a solution doesn't exist in the _Adopt_ ring. Prefer these over those in _Assess_.

3.  **Assess**

   This Indicates that a technology is worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect us. It may be worth investing effort like development spikes or research projects to see if it will have a positive impact on us.

4.  **Hold**

    Don't start new work with these technologies. They are too new to be evaluated, being discontinued, or have been found to be unsuitable.

## ü•ß Quadrants

Quadrants serve to partition the radar into logical groupings to make it more navigable and manageable.

1.  **Languages**
  
  Programming languages.

2.  **Tools**

    Software development tools, such as versions control systems; or continuous integration services.

3.  **Infrastructure**

   Things that we build software on top of like cloud providers such as AWS, components such as databases, etc.

4.  **Frameworks**

    Usefull libraries used in services to reduce boilerplate code, etc.

## How the Radar Changes

When using the radar, you may be tempted to suggest changes to it. You shouldn't. The radar is changed on a regular basis based on experience found since the last update. Try to stick to the radar for your day-to-day work, and keep notes on how things go. We want the radar to be generally stable, but able to evolve.

Lets have a talk about the current or new technologies in the form of `Pull Requests`. See the [technologies](technologies) directory for examples.
